Letâ€™s assume that GrantLoan.inc follows the steps below towards ultimately granting a loan to its customer, who aspires to buy luxury cars.

Application - The customer approaches nodal authorities expressing their interest to apply a loan. They provide an initial set of collateral which will be used by GrantLoan.inc.

Data Gathering - On the basis of the submitted application and collateral provided, the assessor assesses initial credibility of the applicant. S/he requests additional documentation if needed. In response, the customer or the nodal office submits additional information.

Validation and Credit Evaluation - Some assessments are performed to validate customers credibility. At this stage, on successful completion of the validation and credit evaluation process, the loan request gets conditionally approved. Lenders typically evaluate factors like credit-worthiness, loan size, frequency of borrowing, length of commitment as part of the credit evaluation process.

Risk Analysis - As the next step, further analysis is performed by a credit analyst to determine a borrower's ability to meet their debt obligations.

Underwriting - Finally, the lender determines if lending the money would be within the acceptable risk levels. Underwriters are appointed who assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan, based on information produced in the prior steps.

Closing - In closing, all relevant legalities are completed to finalise the disbursement of the loan to the customer.
